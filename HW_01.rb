# HW 01
#
# Purpose:
#
# Read the taks below and complete the exercises in this file. We will start

#
# 1. Read an Interview with the Creator of Ruby

#
# 3. In this file under "Student Solution," print the welcome text of your Secret 
#    Number Game
#
#	(i.e.) "Welcome to the Secret Number Game!"
#
# 4. Above your welcome message, write a comment to other coders introducing yourself.
#	 .
#
#
# 5. Create two new variables, one for your last name, one for your first name
#    and enter your first and last name as strings.
#
#    first_name = ""
#    last_name = ""
#
# 6. Print to the screen that your game was created by you by concating the
#    first and last name variables.

#// hi coders. my name is Dan Tashman and I wrote this script

print "Welcome to the Ruby Secret Number Game!"
#// use print, not puts
first_name = "Dan"
#// use underscore instead of conCatination
last_name = "Tashman"
print "This (particular) game was created by " + first_name + " " + last_name
#// same text syntax as javascript
